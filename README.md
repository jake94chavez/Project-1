## Proposal

### The Game
I intend to make a trivia game based on music. At the most basic level it would be matching song titles or lyrics to the corresponding artist. The ultimate goal would be to have different quizzes for different genres and possibly even have harder quizzes involving questions about music history rather than just simple matching. A stretch for me would be learning how to add music samples to the site so that people could test their knowledge based on the song itself.

### User Personas
+ Audi Ophile
	+ Audi is a music buff that loves to brag about how much she knows about music. She is a music history major at UCLA and loves all types of music from different genres. She is intrigued by the idea that culture and music are intertwined and have very big influence on each other.
+ Notafi Icianado
	+ Notafi is a casual music listener that just likes to listen to music for simple entertainment. He doesn't critique music on a complex level, but simply knows whether or not he likes something or doesn't. He doesn't go out of his way to find new or challenging music but listens to the radio.
